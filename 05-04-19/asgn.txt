C++ Corner :

  std::priority_queue<int> mypq;

  mypq.push(30);
  mypq.push(100);
  mypq.push(25);
  mypq.push(40);

  std::cout << "Popping out elements...";
  while (!mypq.empty())
  {
     std::cout << ' ' << mypq.top();
     mypq.pop();
  }





Assignment :
 -> Implement FIFO queue and stack using priority queue.
 -> Think about the time complexities of functions covered !
