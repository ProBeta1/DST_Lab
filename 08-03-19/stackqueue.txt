ADT :

An abstract data type is a model that describes how data is manipulated from the point of view of the user.
In other words, the user should get a set of functions and behaviors that are identical regardless of how the model is implemented.

There are many open source implementations of STL. However it is difficult to read the STL code because it is meant to be practically usable than readable.



STACK :  LIFO
Operations - 
	push(x)
	pop()
	isempty()
	top()

Most computer architectures implement a stack at the very core of their instruction sets — both push and pop are assembly code instructions. Stack operations are so useful that there is a stack built in to every program running on your PC — the stack is a memory block that gets used to store the state of memory when a function is called, and to restore it when a function returns.

Limits:
No random access
